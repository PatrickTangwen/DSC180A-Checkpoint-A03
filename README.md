# DSC180A-Checkpoint-A03-Data_Integration

 Built on the previous year’s project, this project aims to make improvements include utilizing Vital, an API that helps us pull in patients’ health data from their wearables, which allows us to scale our project to multiple users, thus improving our dashboard’s reach. Another improvement was updating our database in order to automate the data integration process and handle a rising user base.
